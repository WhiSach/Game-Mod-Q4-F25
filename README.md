\## Installation Instructions

2\. \*\*Copy\*\* the entire `ModTest` folder into that directory.  

3\. \*\*Launch the mod\*\* in one of the following ways:

&nbsp;  - \*\*In-game method:\*\*  

&nbsp;    Run `Quake4.exe` → go to the \*\*Mods\*\* menu → select \*\*ModTest\*\* → click \*\*Load Mod\*\*.  

&nbsp;  - \*\*Command-line/shortcut method:\*\*  

&nbsp;    Run Quake 4 with the following flag:

\## How to Play (WIP)



\### Currently Implemented

\- \*\*Sonic Ring / Health System:\*\*  

&nbsp; When the player takes damage, they \*\*drop rings (health shards)\*\* — just like Sonic losing rings when hit.



\### In Progress

\- \*\*Five Sonic Movement Abilities:\*\*  

&nbsp; Custom mobility mechanics inspired by Sonic’s signature speed and agility.

&nbsp; 

\- \*\*Five Sonic Pickups:\*\*  

&nbsp; Powerups and collectibles designed to enhance gameplay variety.

&nbsp; 

\- \*\*Sonic-Based Combat States:\*\*  

&nbsp; Enemies will take damage \*\*only when Sonic is in a spin attack state\*\*; standard states won’t cause damage.

&nbsp; 

\- \*\*Five World Interactables:\*\*  

&nbsp; Environmental objects such as:

&nbsp; - Dash Panels  

&nbsp; - Stop Panels
